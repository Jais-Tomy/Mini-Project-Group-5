        Technology is advancing rapidly in present times. To serve as a useful and connected part of the community, everyone is required to learn and update themselves on innovations. Visually impaired people fall behind in this regard because of their inherent limitations. To involve these people as active participants within communities, technology must be modified for their facilitation. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of various user input schemes designed for the visually impaired for Braille to natural language conversion. These techniques are analyzed in detail with a focus on their accessibility and usability. Currently, considerable effort has been made to design a touch-screen input mechanism for visually impaired people, such as Braille Touch, Braille Enter, and Edge Braille. All of these schemes use location-specific input and challenge visually impaired persons to locate specified places on the touch screen. Most of the schemes require special actions to switch between upper and lowercase and between numbers and special characters, which affects system usability. The key features used for accessing the performance of these techniques are efficiency, accuracy, and usability issues found in the applications. In the end, a comparison of all these techniques is performed. Outcomes of this analysis show that there is a strong need for application that put the least burden on the visually impaired users. Based on this survey, a guideline has been designed for future research in this area.
        
        1. Introduction
        Visually impaired people are an important part of every community [1]. They are also concerned in learning the details of everything they encounter in their daily life [2]. The total number of visually impaired people is 2.2 billion; among them, 36 million are completely blind, and rest of the 1 billion have moderate to severe vision impairment [3].
        
        Approximately thirty-seven million of the six billion populations worldwide are suffering from blindness. Unfortunately, 80% of blind people live in developing countries with restricted facilities for them [4].
        
        Smartphones have become an integral part of everyday life. An expected increase of smartphone users will increase up to nine billion by 2022 [5]. The widespread use of smartphones has brought significant changes in how people learn. Research indicates that about one-third of smartphone usage consists of educational activities. Although smartphone usage has increased exponentially, it has low prevalence among people with visual disabilities. There are many complex accessibility issues that must be resolved in order to enable the full inclusion of this community [6]. Accessibility issues have been an important research domain over the last few years promoting the development of thousands of smartphone applications to help people with a visual disability, e.g., voiceOver services, talkback services, screen readers, and navigators.
        
        These researches resulted in a dramatic increase in mobile-screen reader usage for the visually impaired, from 12% in 2009 to 88% in 2019 [7]. Despite the benefits that smart devices can offer, if the learning applications are not properly designed, their touch-screen interfaces may place an extra burden on blind learners. There are features such as VoiceOver for iPhone that help blind users interact with their device and browse content. However, educational applications often fail to consider the interaction patterns of blind learners with smart devices.
        
        The language visually impaired people use for reading and writing is known as Braille, which was designed by Louis Braille. It is composed of six raised dots that can be easily written by visually impaired [8]. His design is illustrated in Figure 1. Each Braille character is represented using a combination of six dots arranged in a 3 by 2 matrix [9].
        The Braille code system has been widely adopted in several communities because of its simplicity and comfort. Braille has been supported by different languages such as English, Arabic, and Hindi, among others [10]. However, few studies have been conducted on Braille for smartphones.

        Research on Braille to text conversion has been carried out in the USA, Canada, India, Pakistan, and France. The literature shows that majority of the conducted research is limited to the USA and Canada. This indicates that there is a considerable demand for such a study in the rest of the world [6].
        
        With the advancement of technology, Braille scripting mechanisms became an important research domain. Within this category, an initial device called Perkins Brailler was introduced to facilitate Braille writing. Space, backspace, and line space keys were designed in Perkins Brailler, as well as keys corresponding with each of the six dots in the Braille code [11]. In 2008, a lighter and quieter version was developed and launched that included an erase key and integrated carrying handle, which was not available in Perkins Brailler.
        
        Another adaptation of the Perkins Brailler, the SMART Brailler, was created by David S. Morgan and released in 2011 [12]. Along with the existing features, Smart Brailler also included text-to-speech functionality in several languages. With the advent of computers, many users created Braille output by connecting a computer and Braille embosser. Visually impaired users were able to read the computer screen using screen reader computer software and/or Braille displays. Another similar Braille recognition system was designed by [13]. In this scheme, images were distributed into three threshold values, and Braille characters were subsequently recognized. Effectively, this interpretation was used to create a suitable dictionary. Recent research has focused on eliminating the need for separate hardware in Braille scripting. Application-level software has been designed to facilitate Braille users.
        
        This survey focuses on gathering the difficulties faced by visually impaired while using a computing-based Braille input mechanism. Many technology-oriented applications for the visually impaired are available. Only those applications are considered for these surveys that are part of research taking place in different countries. Studied applications were analyzed and compared based on matrices related to usability issues for touch-screen-based Braille input methods. These evaluations bring forward the strengths and weaknesses of current schemes with a special focus on usability. No such study exists in the literature, so this paper can provide guidelines to the researchers for designing future applications that are highly usable for visually impaired people.
        
        This paper comprises the following sections. Section 2 gives a detail insight into the previous studies that have been designed for entering Braille data. Section 3 describes the methodology in detail. Input methods are compared and evaluated in Section 4. Usability issues gathered from different studies are also included in this section. Section 5 concludes the paper and gives future recommendations.
        
        2. Previous Work
        This survey paper provides a review of the current state-of-the-art Braille input methods. In this section, we provide a detailed insight into the problems with these schemes when these are used by visually impaired people. Based on the current survey, we have identified new directions for future research. In recent years, many studies have been conducted to make Braille more technology-assisted. To analyze these studies, we have broadly divided the Braille input mechanism into two main categories:
        (i)	Scanned Input
        (ii)	Touch-Screen-based Input
        
        2.1. Scanned Input
        In the scanned Braille input, Braille Dots are extracted from Braille sheets using a scanner and, then, converted into text using optical character recognition, as shown in Figure 2. In this mechanism, visually impaired users give input on sheets without any interaction with a computing device.\
